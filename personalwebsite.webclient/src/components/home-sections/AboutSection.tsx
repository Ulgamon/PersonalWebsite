            <p className="max-w-[500px] my-4">
              Welcome to my personal website! I'm Justin IliÄ‡, a full stack
              developer based in Serbia. I have a deep love for playing guitar,
              basketball, programming, and calisthenics.
            </p>
            <p className="max-w-[500px] my-4">
              I believe in the power of continuous learning and innovation, and
              I'm passionate about creating impactful solutions that make a
              difference. Whether I'm crafting code, strumming chords on my
              guitar, shooting hoops on the basketball court, or challenging
              myself with calisthenics routines, I'm always seeking to improve
              and grow.
            </p>
            <p className="max-w-[500px] my-4">
              Through my work as a full stack developer, I aim to build
              user-friendly applications that enhance people's lives and
              experiences. When I'm not immersed in coding, you can find me
              exploring new places or enjoying quality time with friends and
              family.
            </p>
